Why Ehcache 3 + Spring Boot needs Jakarta/Javax Cache (JSR-107)

Spring Cache abstraction

Spring Boot doesn’t talk directly to Ehcache classes (org.ehcache.CacheManager).

Instead, it talks to a generic Spring CacheManager (org.springframework.cache.CacheManager), which can wrap different providers (Ehcache, Hazelcast, Redis, Caffeine, etc).

Ehcache 3 design

Ehcache 3’s core API is org.ehcache.CacheManager, Cache, etc.

But for integration with external frameworks (Spring, JEE, Hibernate), Ehcache 3 implements the JSR-107 JCache API (javax.cache.CacheManager).

That’s why Ehcache 3 ships with a JCache provider (org.ehcache.jsr107.EhcacheCachingProvider).

Spring Boot integration path

Spring Boot doesn’t ship a direct adapter for org.ehcache.CacheManager (that was for Ehcache 2).

Instead, it supports Ehcache 3 via JCache → so you need a javax.cache.CacheManager exposed, which Spring wraps in JCacheCacheManager.

**Design Considerations for the Generic Java Solution**

1. **API Call Type Configuration**
   The API call type (GET or POST) will be defined in the MongoDB configuration. This allows dynamic selection of the HTTP method based on the setup.

2. **Request Scope Configuration**
   The API can be triggered for either a single record or a full batch of records. This behavior will also be controlled through the MongoDB configuration.

3. **Request Body Handling**
   The request body may be empty, depending on the specific API and its configuration.

4. **API URL Structure**
   The final API URL will be built using the following components:

   * Domain URL (required)
   * Service Name (optional)
   * Operation (optional)

5. **Request Object Composition**
   The request object will always include:

   * mapDefId
   * requestId
   * mapData
   * configData (if available)

   If the mapType is "file", an additional field `filePath` will be included.

6. **Response Object Structure**
   The response will contain:

   * A status field indicating overall success or failure (e.g., "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE")
   * A message field providing a brief description or details about the outcome
   * A list of sequences, where each sequence number is associated with a result ("SUCCESS" or "FAILURE"). For example:

     * Sequence 12345: SUCCESS
     * Sequence 12346: FAILURE
